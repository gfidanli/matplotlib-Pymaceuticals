    <h1>Pymaceuticals</h1>
    <p> For this project, I analyzed a ficticious dataset of clincial trials <br>
        to determine how different treatments effect tumor volume in rats and their various survival rates.<br>
        This project utilizes Pandas and Matplotlib and was completed as a homework assignment<br>
        for my data analytics bootcamp offered by UC Berkeley Extension
